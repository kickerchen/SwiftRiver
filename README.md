# SwiftRiver 🌊

A lightweight dependency injection & state management framework for Swift, inspired by Riverpod.

> ⚠️ **Current Status**: Core architecture is implemented and functional. Not yet recommended for production use. Feedback and contributions welcome.

**Requires**: Swift 5.9+, iOS 17+, macOS 14+

## Introduction

SwiftRiver lets you declare dependencies and state as **providers** — lazy, composable units that SwiftUI reads and re-renders from automatically. A `Provider` describes how to build a value; `ref.watch()` wires up dependencies between providers without you managing lifecycles by hand.

What you get out of the box:

- **Dependency injection** without a service locator or manual wiring — providers declare what they need, and the graph resolves it.
- **Sync, mutable, and async state** through `Provider`, `Provider.state()`, and `AsyncProvider`, each backed by `@Observable` so SwiftUI updates automatically.
- **Automatic cleanup** — `autoDispose` cascades through the dependency graph, so unused providers (and their now-unused dependencies) are released without manual bookkeeping.
- **Thread-safety by construction** — the entire provider graph lives inside a single `actor`, so there are no locks, no `DispatchQueue`, and no data races to reason about.
- **Native SwiftUI integration** via `ProviderScope` and `@Environment`, plus an observer hook for logging and debugging.

If you've used Riverpod in Flutter, the shape will feel familiar — providers, `ref.watch()`, `autoDispose` — reimagined around Swift's actor model instead of Dart's zones.

## Comparison

| | SwiftRiver | TCA | Riverpod (Flutter) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift | Swift | Dart |
| Graph isolation | `actor` | Swift Concurrency | Dart isolates |
| UI reactivity | `@Observable` | `@ObservableState` | `ref.watch()` |
| Async state | `AsyncState<T>` enum | `Effect` | `AsyncNotifier` |
| autoDispose | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Learning curve | Low–Medium | High | Medium |
| Production ready | ❌ Not yet | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

> TCA is battle-tested and excellent. SwiftRiver explores a smaller, more direct surface area — fewer concepts, with Swift Concurrency as the primary isolation primitive.

## Why it's called SwiftRiver

The name is a nod to [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev), the Flutter state-management library. After spending time with Riverpod on the Flutter side, I got curious whether its core idea — providers as lazy, composable, auto-disposable dependency declarations — could be expressed idiomatically in Swift, using actors rather than Dart's zone system.

Most Swift state-management approaches either:

- Wrap `@Published` / `ObservableObject` with thin abstractions — inheriting all of Combine's thread-safety ambiguities, or
- Port patterns from other ecosystems without embracing what Swift's actor model actually offers.

The specific question I kept asking: *what does Riverpod's provider graph look like if the graph itself is an `actor`, and synchronous dependency reads inside factories use `assumeIsolated` to assert — rather than hope — that isolation is already held?*

SwiftRiver is my answer to that question, and this project is as much an exploration of **Swift Concurrency correctness** as it is a usable framework. If the design thinking interests you, open a Discussion.

## Core Concepts

### `Provider<T>`

The fundamental unit. A `Provider` declares *how* to create a value — lazily, with automatic dependency tracking via `Ref`.

```swift
let networkProvider = Provider<URLSession>("network", keepAlive: true) { _ in
    URLSession.shared
}

let repositoryProvider = Provider<UserRepository>("userRepo") { ref in
    let session = ref.watch(networkProvider)  // tracked dependency
    ref.onDispose { print("repo disposed") }
    return UserRepository(session: session)
}
```

### `Provider.state()` — Mutable State

A convenience factory that wraps an initial value in a `StateHolder<T>` — an `@Observable` class that drives SwiftUI re-renders automatically.

```swift
let counterProvider = Provider<StateHolder<Int>>.state("counter", initial: 0)
```

### `AsyncProvider<T>`

For values that require async work to produce (network calls, disk reads). Returns a `StateHolder<AsyncState<T>>` immediately in `.loading`, then transitions to `.data` or `.error`.

```swift
let userProvider = AsyncProvider<User>("currentUser") { ref in
    let repo = ref.watch(userRepositoryProvider)
    return try await repo.fetchCurrentUser()
}
```

### `ProviderContainer`

The public interface. A thin `@Observable` wrapper around the actor-isolated `ProviderGraph`.

```swift
let container = ProviderContainer()

// Async read (preferred)
let session = await container.read(networkProvider)

// Watch an async provider — returns immediately with .loading state
let userHolder = await container.watch(userProvider)
```

### `ProviderScope` — SwiftUI Integration

Injects a `ProviderContainer` into the SwiftUI environment for the entire view subtree.

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ProviderScope(observers: [LoggingObserver()]) {
                ContentView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Consume in any view via `@Environment`:

```swift
struct UserView: View {
    @Environment(\.providerContainer) private var container
    @State private var userHolder: StateHolder<AsyncState<User>>?

    var body: some View {
        Group {
            switch userHolder?.state {
            case .loading, nil:  ProgressView()
            case .data(let u):   Text(u.name)
            case .error(let e):  Text(e.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
        .task {
            userHolder = await container.watch(userProvider)
        }
    }
}
```

## Design Decisions & Tradeoffs

### The graph is an `actor`

`ProviderGraph` is a Swift `actor`. All cache reads, writes, and graph edge registrations are serialized by the actor's executor — no locks, no queues, no `DispatchQueue.main.async` boilerplate.

### `assumeIsolated` inside `Ref.watch()`

When a provider factory calls `ref.watch(anotherProvider)`, it needs to read and register a graph edge synchronously — without `await`. This is safe because `build()` calls `factory(ref)` *while already holding the actor's turn*. There is no suspension between entering the actor and calling the factory, so no other task can interleave.

`assumeIsolated` asserts this guarantee at runtime:

```swift
public func watch<T>(_ provider: Provider<T>) -> T {
    graph.assumeIsolated { graph in
        graph.registerEdge(from: nodeKey, to: provider.key)
        return graph.read(provider)
    }
}
```

If the assertion is ever violated, the program crashes immediately — a loud failure rather than a silent data race.

### `@Observable` over `ObservableObject`

`StateHolder<T>` and `ProviderContainer` use Swift 5.9's `@Observable` macro. This gives fine-grained property-level tracking — SwiftUI views only re-render when the specific property they read changes, not on any mutation to the object.

### autoDispose with cascade

When a provider with no `keepAlive` loses all its dependents, it is automatically disposed. Disposal cascades upstream: if a now-unused provider was the last dependent of its own dependency, that dependency is disposed too — preventing memory leaks in long-running apps.

## Observability — `ProviderObserver`

Plug in observers to monitor the lifecycle of every provider — useful for logging, analytics, or debugging:

```swift
struct LoggingObserver: ProviderObserver {
    func didAddProvider(_ key: ProviderKey, value: Any) {
        print("[River] ✅  \(key)")
    }
    func didDisposeProvider(_ key: ProviderKey) {
        print("[River] 🗑️  \(key)")
    }
}

ProviderScope(observers: [LoggingObserver()]) { ... }
```

## Contributing

The best way to contribute right now:

1. Open an issue with your use case or questions about the API design
2. Try wiring it up in a small app and report what breaks
3. Review the `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the internal design and share feedback
